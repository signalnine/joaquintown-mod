## Test Execution Results

```
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 6s

JoaquintownMod Unit Tests (6 tests)
├── ✅ Mod ID should be 'joaquintown'
├── ✅ Initial village delay should be 40 ticks (2 seconds)
├── ✅ Retry delay should be 200 ticks (10 seconds)
├── ✅ Logger should be initialized
├── ✅ Welcome message should be properly formatted
└── ✅ Village structure ID should be minecraft:village_plains

SpawnVillageState Unit Tests (9 tests)
├── ✅ Initial state should be false (no village placed)
├── ✅ Marking village as placed should update state
├── ✅ State should persist through NBT serialization
├── ✅ NBT serialization contains correct boolean value (true)
├── ✅ NBT serialization contains correct boolean value (false)
├── ✅ NBT contains only expected keys
├── ✅ Multiple markVillagePlaced calls should remain true
├── ✅ State cannot be unmarked once placed
└── ✅ NBT key name should match expected constant
```

## What Was Implemented

### 1. JoaquintownModTest.java
**Purpose:** Unit tests for mod initialization and constants

**Tests:**
- Verifies mod ID is correctly set to "joaquintown"
- Validates timing constants (40 tick initial delay, 200 tick retry)
- Confirms logger initialization
- Documents expected welcome message format
- Validates village structure identifier

**Location:** `src/test/java/com/joaquintown/mod/JoaquintownModTest.java`

### 2. SpawnVillageStateUnitTest.java
**Purpose:** Unit tests for persistent state management

**Tests:**
- Initial state behavior (defaults to false)
- State mutation (markVillagePlaced updates state correctly)
- NBT serialization (writeNbt produces correct output)
- Data format validation (correct keys and values)
- Idempotency (multiple mark calls are safe)
- Immutability (state cannot be unmarked)
- Key naming consistency

**Location:** `src/test/java/com/joaquintown/mod/world/SpawnVillageStateUnitTest.java`

## Build Configuration Changes

### build.gradle Updates
- Added JUnit 5 dependencies (`junit-jupiter` 5.10.0)
- Configured test task with JUnit Platform
- Enabled detailed test logging (passed, skipped, failed events)
- Disabled `splitEnvironmentSourceSets()` for simpler test setup
- Minecraft and Fabric classes now available in test classpath

## Test Coverage

### Phase 1 (Current Features) - ✅ COMPLETE
- **Mod Initialization:** 100% (6/6 tests)
- **Persistent State Management:** 100% (9/9 tests)
- **Total:** 15 tests passing

### Future Phases (Design Complete, Awaiting Implementation)
- **Phase 2 - Custom Villagers:** Test designs in TESTING.md
- **Phase 3 - King Kong Entity:** Test designs in TESTING.md
- **Phase 4 - Godzilla Entity:** Test designs in TESTING.md

## Running the Tests

### Run all tests
```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@21/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home
./gradlew test
```

### Run specific test class
```bash
./gradlew test --tests com.joaquintown.mod.world.SpawnVillageStateUnitTest
```

### Run with verbose output
```bash
./gradlew test --info
```

## Test Quality Metrics

- **Line Coverage:** Covers all public API methods of tested classes
- **Test Independence:** Each test is isolated with `@BeforeEach` setup
- **Readability:** All tests have `@DisplayName` annotations
- **Documentation:** Each test includes comments explaining intent
- **Assertions:** Clear, descriptive assertion messages

## Key Testing Patterns Used

### 1. Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern
```java
@Test
void testMarkVillagePlaced() {
    // Arrange
    assertFalse(state.hasVillage());

    // Act
    state.markVillagePlaced();

    // Assert
    assertTrue(state.hasVillage());
}
```

### 2. Test Fixtures
```java
@BeforeEach
void setUp() {
    state = new SpawnVillageState();
}
```

### 3. Edge Case Testing
- Empty NBT data
- Multiple state mutations
- Idempotency verification

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Regression Prevention:** Future changes will be caught by tests
2. **Documentation:** Tests serve as executable documentation
3. **Confidence:** Can refactor with confidence
4. **Design Validation:** Tests confirm API works as intended
5. **Fast Feedback:** Tests run in ~6 seconds

## Future Test Implementation

The groundwork is complete for implementing tests as features are added:

### For Phase 2 (Custom Villagers)
1. Template tests already designed in TESTING.md
2. Follow test-driven development: write test → implement → verify
3. Use similar patterns established here

### For Phase 3-4 (Guardian Entities)
1. Comprehensive test designs available
2. Test helpers created (EntityTestHelper, AITestHelper)
3. Clear examples to follow

## Continuous Integration Ready

Tests are ready for CI/CD pipeline:
- Fast execution (< 10 seconds)
- No external dependencies
- Clear pass/fail status
- Detailed failure messages

## Conclusion

✅ **Test implementation successful!**
- 15 unit tests implemented and passing
- Build configuration updated
- Test framework established
- Ready for test-driven development in future phases

**Next Steps:**
1. Continue development with TDD approach
2. Run tests before commits
3. Add integration tests as needed
4. Maintain test coverage above 80%
