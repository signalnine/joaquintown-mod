- ✅ Fabric API available for tests

### Test Files
- ✅ All test classes created
- ✅ All test methods designed with clear specifications
- ✅ Test utilities implemented
- ⏸️ Tests for Phase 2-4 contain TODO markers (awaiting implementation)
- ⏸️ Some tests require Minecraft runtime (Fabric Game Test framework)

### Documentation
- ✅ TESTING.md created with comprehensive guide
- ✅ Test categories documented
- ✅ Test-driven development workflow explained
- ✅ Best practices included
- ✅ CI/CD example provided

## Note on Compilation

The current test files use Fabric's GameTest framework which requires special setup with Minecraft runtime. Tests are designed to compile once:

1. The target features are implemented (Phases 2-4), OR
2. Fabric Game Test environment is fully configured

For Phase 1 (current features), tests can be adapted to standard JUnit tests without GameTest if desired.

## How to Use These Tests

### For Current Development (Phase 1)
1. Tests are **fully designed** - just uncomment and implement
2. Each test has clear "Expected:" documentation
3. Use test helpers to reduce boilerplate

### For Future Development (Phases 2-4)
1. When starting a new feature (e.g., King Kong):
   - Open `KingKongEntityTest.java`
   - Pick a test (e.g., `testKingKongSpawn`)
   - Replace TODO comments with actual code
   - Run test (it will fail - RED)
   - Implement the feature
   - Run test until it passes (GREEN)
   - Refactor if needed

2. Follow test-driven development:
   - ✅ Tests already designed (DONE)
   - 🔴 Write minimal code to make test compile
   - 🔴 Run test (should fail)
   - 🟢 Implement feature
   - 🟢 Run test (should pass)
   - 🔵 Refactor
   - Repeat for next test

### Example Workflow

```java
// 1. Find test in KingKongEntityTest.java
@GameTest(templateName = FabricGameTest.EMPTY_STRUCTURE)
public void testKingKongHealth(TestContext context) {
    // 2. Implement after creating entity
    KingKongEntity kong = ModEntities.KING_KONG.create(context.getWorld());
    context.assertTrue(kong.getMaxHealth() == 200.0f,
        "King Kong should have 200 HP");
    context.complete();
}
```

## Test Commands

Once tests are ready to run:

```bash
# Run all tests
./gradlew test

# Run specific test class
./gradlew test --tests com.joaquintown.mod.VillageSpawningTest

# Run specific test method
./gradlew test --tests com.joaquintown.mod.VillageSpawningTest.testVillageSpawnScheduling

# Run with verbose output
./gradlew test --info
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Specifications as Code**: Tests document exactly what each feature should do
2. **Regression Prevention**: Tests catch bugs when making changes
3. **Design Validation**: Writing tests first reveals design issues early
4. **Living Documentation**: Tests show how to use each feature
5. **Confidence**: Know immediately if changes break existing functionality

## Test Coverage Goals

### Current
- Village Spawning: 5 tests
- Persistent State: 7 tests

### Target
- Phase 2: 9 tests for custom villagers
- Phase 3: 16 tests for King Kong
- Phase 4: 21 tests for Godzilla

**Total: 58 tests** covering all major features

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Test framework is set up
2. ✅ Tests are designed
3. ⏭️ Implement Phase 1 features using existing tests
4. ⏭️ Implement Phase 2-4 features using test-driven development
5. ⏭️ Run `./gradlew test` regularly during development
6. ⏭️ Keep test coverage above 80%
