This directory contains texture overrides for vanilla Minecraft villagers.

By placing villager.png here, we override the default villager texture
with the custom Joaquin villager texture (with curly hair).

This affects ALL villagers in the game, which is the intended behavior
for the Joaquintown mod.

Original texture location: assets/joaquintown/textures/entity/villager/joaquin_villager.png
Override location: assets/minecraft/textures/entity/villager/villager.png
