## 🔧 Technical Details

### Files Modified
- Villager textures (profession and type variants)
- Villager model (nose removal via mixin)

## 📝 Known Issues

- **Best with New Worlds**: Structures and guardians spawn in new worlds only
- **Existing Worlds**: Villager textures work, but spawn village won't generate
