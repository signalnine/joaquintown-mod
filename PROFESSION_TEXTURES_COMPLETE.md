## How It Works

### Texture Composition
Each profession texture (64x64 pixels) contains:

**Head Section (top area):**
- Your custom Joaquin head with curly hair and accessories
- Extracted from your `joaquin_villager.png` texture
- Includes both base head (left) and head layer 2 (right)

**Body Section (bottom area):**
- Vanilla profession-specific body
- Extracted from Minecraft's original profession textures
- Includes unique clothing, tools, and accessories for each profession

### Technical Process
The script used ImageMagick to:
1. Extract head portion from custom texture (top 32x32 pixels)
2. Extract body portion from vanilla profession texture
3. Composite custom head onto profession body
4. Save as profession-specific texture

### In-Game Behavior
Minecraft automatically loads profession-specific textures:
- When a villager takes a profession, it looks for `profession/{name}.png`
- If found, uses that texture instead of base `villager.png`
- Your textures are in the override location, so they take priority!

## Testing In-Game

### Quick Test:
```bash
./gradlew runClient
```

### Commands to Test Each Profession:

```minecraft
# Spawn villagers with specific professions

/summon minecraft:villager ~ ~ ~ {VillagerData:{profession:"minecraft:farmer"}}
/summon minecraft:villager ~ ~ ~ {VillagerData:{profession:"minecraft:librarian"}}
/summon minecraft:villager ~ ~ ~ {VillagerData:{profession:"minecraft:cleric"}}
/summon minecraft:villager ~ ~ ~ {VillagerData:{profession:"minecraft:armorer"}}
/summon minecraft:villager ~ ~ ~ {VillagerData:{profession:"minecraft:weaponsmith"}}
```

### What You Should See:

**All villagers will have:**
- ✅ Joaquin's curly hair
- ✅ Joaquin's accessories
- ✅ Flat face (no protruding nose)
- ✅ Profession-specific clothing/tools

**Examples:**
- **Farmer:** Brown straw hat + your Joaquin head
- **Librarian:** White robe with accessories + curly hair
- **Armorer:** Welding mask + your custom head showing through
- **Cleric:** Purple robe + accessories and curly hair

## Visual Comparison

### Before (All Same):
```
Farmer:      Joaquin head + Joaquin body
Librarian:   Joaquin head + Joaquin body
Cleric:      Joaquin head + Joaquin body
```

### After (Profession-Specific):
```
Farmer:      Joaquin head + Brown farmer clothes
Librarian:   Joaquin head + White robe with book
Cleric:      Joaquin head + Purple cleric robe
```

## Script Created

**File:** `combine_head_profession_bodies.sh`

This automated script:
- Extracts vanilla profession textures from Minecraft
- Extracts your custom head from joaquin_villager.png
- Combines them using ImageMagick
- Outputs profession-specific textures

**Usage:**
```bash
./combine_head_profession_bodies.sh
```

Can be re-run anytime you update the head texture!

## Updating the Head

If you want to modify the head (change hair, accessories, etc.):

1. Edit `src/main/resources/assets/joaquintown/textures/entity/villager/joaquin_villager.png`
2. Re-run: `./combine_head_profession_bodies.sh`
3. Rebuild: `./gradlew build`
4. Test: `./gradlew runClient`

All professions will automatically get the updated head!

## Technical Details

### Why This Works
Minecraft's texture system:
1. Checks for profession-specific texture first
2. Falls back to generic `villager.png` if not found
3. Resource packs override vanilla textures

Our mod provides profession textures in the override location (`assets/minecraft/textures/...`), so they take priority over vanilla.

### ImageMagick Commands Used
```bash
# Extract head (32x16 pixels from top-left)
convert input.png -crop 32x16+0+0 output.png

# Extract head layer 2 (32x16 pixels from top-right)
convert input.png -crop 32x16+32+0 output.png

# Composite onto profession texture
convert profession.png \
        custom_head.png -geometry +0+0 -composite \
        custom_head_layer2.png -geometry +32+0 -composite \
        output.png
```

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Test and Refine
- Launch game and check each profession
- Verify head looks good on each body type
- Make adjustments if needed

### Option 2: Continue Development
- **Phase 3:** King Kong guardian entity
- **Phase 4:** Godzilla guardian entity
- **Phase 5:** Custom village structures
