## Even Faster: Exact Pixel Locations

If you want to edit in an image editor, here are the exact pixels to change:

**Nose Location:** Base head section (top-left quarter of 64x64 texture)
- **X coordinates:** 20, 21, 22, 23 (from left)
- **Y coordinates:** 10, 11, 12, 13 (from top)

**What to do:**
1. Open texture in any image editor
2. Zoom to 800%
3. Select pixels at (20-23, 10-13)
4. Fill with skin color (use eyedropper on nearby pixels)
5. Save

**Colors:**
- Replace: `#786C58` or `#6B5C4F` (nose gray/brown)
- With: `#C59978` or `#D4A58A` (skin peach/tan)

## Result

Before: ðŸ‘ƒ (big nose)
After:  ðŸ‘” (flat face or subtle nose)
