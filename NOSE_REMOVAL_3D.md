# 3D Nose Removal - Complete! ‚úÖ

## What Was Done

The villager's protruding 3D nose has been removed by modifying the entity model rendering.

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Created VillagerModelMixin
**File:** `src/main/java/com/joaquintown/mod/mixin/VillagerModelMixin.java`

This mixin injects into the `VillagerResemblingModel` constructor and sets the nose ModelPart to invisible:

```java
@Inject(method = "<init>", at = @At("RETURN"))
private void removeNose(CallbackInfo ci) {
    if (this.nose != null) {
        this.nose.visible = false;
    }
}
```

**What this does:**
- Targets the villager model when it's created
- Makes the `nose` ModelPart invisible
- The nose geometry still exists but doesn't render
- Works for ALL villagers (vanilla behavior)

### 2. Created NoNoseVillagerRenderer (Optional)
**File:** `src/main/java/com/joaquintown/mod/client/NoNoseVillagerRenderer.java`

A custom renderer that can be used if you want more control over villager rendering in the future.

### 3. Updated Mixin Configuration
**File:** `src/main/resources/joaquintown.mixins.json`

Added `VillagerModelMixin` to the `"client"` section since model rendering is client-side only.

## How It Works

### Before (Vanilla):
- Villager model has a `nose` ModelPart
- Nose geometry protrudes from the face
- Rendered on all villagers

### After (With Mixin):
- Villager model still has the `nose` ModelPart
- Nose visibility is set to `false` when model is created
- Nose doesn't render = flat face!
- Your skin-colored texture completes the flat-nose look

## Testing

### Build Status: ‚úÖ SUCCESS
All tests passed, mixin compiled successfully.

### Test In-Game:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@21/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home
./gradlew runClient
```

### What You Should See:

1. **Launch game** (30 seconds)
2. **Create/load world**
3. **Summon villager:** `/summon minecraft:villager ~ ~ ~`
4. **Check the face:**
   - ‚úÖ No protruding nose!
   - ‚úÖ Flat face
   - ‚úÖ Your custom texture (curly hair, accessories)
   - ‚úÖ Skin-colored where nose used to be

### Compare:
- **Vanilla villager:** Big protruding nose üëÉ
- **Your villager:** Flat face, no nose protrusion üë§

## Advantages of This Approach

### 1. Works Automatically
- Applies to ALL villagers
- No need to replace entities
- Works with breeding, trading, all vanilla mechanics

### 2. Compatible
- Other mods that use villagers will also have flat noses
- No conflicts with vanilla villager behavior
- Just a visual change

### 3. Clean Code
- Single mixin file
- Non-invasive (doesn't replace classes)
- Easy to maintain

### 4. Performance
- No performance impact
- Just sets a boolean flag
- Happens once per villager model creation

## Troubleshooting

### Nose still visible?
1. Make sure you rebuilt: `./gradlew build`
2. Check mixin is registered in `joaquintown.mixins.json`
3. Look for mixin errors in logs: `run/logs/latest.log`

### Game crashes?
1. Check logs: `run/logs/latest.log`
2. Look for mixin application errors
3. Verify mixin syntax is correct

### Nose texture still shows?
- That's normal! The texture can still have nose colors
- The 3D protrusion is what's removed
- Consider updating texture to be completely flat skin color

## How Mixins Work (For Learning)

**Mixins** are a way to modify Minecraft's code without replacing it:

1. **Target:** `VillagerResemblingModel.class` (the villager's 3D model)
2. **Injection Point:** Constructor `<init>` method, at RETURN (after model is built)
3. **Modification:** Set `nose.visible = false`
4. **Result:** Nose doesn't render, but model otherwise unchanged

This is much cleaner than:
- ‚ùå Replacing the entire villager entity
- ‚ùå Creating a custom model from scratch
- ‚ùå Using reflection hacks

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Refine
- Test different villager types (biomes, professions)
- Verify baby villagers also have flat noses
- Check villager zombies (they use same model)

### Option 2: Continue Development
- **Phase 3:** King Kong entity implementation
- **Phase 4:** Godzilla entity implementation
- **Phase 5:** Custom village structures

## Additional Notes

### Other ModelParts You Could Modify:

The villager model has these parts:
- `head` - The head
- `nose` - The nose (now hidden!)
- `body` - The body/torso
- `arms` - The arms
- `rightLeg` - Right leg
- `leftLeg` - Left leg
- `hat` - Hat layer (head layer 2)

You could modify any of these by accessing them in the mixin.

### Future Enhancements:

If you want to do more with the model:
- Scale body parts (make head bigger, etc.)
- Add custom animations
- Change model positions
- Add completely new ModelParts

## Conclusion

‚úÖ **3D nose removal complete!**

Your villagers now have:
- ‚úÖ Flat faces (no protruding nose geometry)
- ‚úÖ Custom texture (curly hair, accessories)
- ‚úÖ Skin-colored where nose was
- ‚úÖ All vanilla villager behaviors intact

**Build successful, ready to test!**

Run: `./gradlew runClient`
