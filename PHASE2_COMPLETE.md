# Phase 2 Complete: Custom Joaquin Villager Textures

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### Custom Texture Integration
Your custom Joaquin villager texture (with curly hair and accessories) has been successfully integrated into the mod!

**Files Added:**
- `src/main/resources/assets/joaquintown/textures/entity/villager/joaquin_villager.png` - Your custom texture
- `src/main/resources/assets/minecraft/textures/entity/villager/villager.png` - Override of vanilla texture
- `src/main/resources/pack.mcmeta` - Resource pack metadata

**How It Works:**
The mod now includes a resource pack that overrides the vanilla villager texture. This means **all villagers** in any world will display your custom Joaquin appearance!

## üéÆ Testing Your Texture In-Game

### Method 1: Quick Test with Dev Client

1. **Start the development client:**
   ```bash
   export JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@21/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home
   ./gradlew runClient
   ```

2. **Create or load a world:**
   - Click "Singleplayer"
   - Create a new world or load existing

3. **See your custom villagers:**
   - Wait 2 seconds after spawn - a village will automatically generate at spawn!
   - Look for villagers in the village
   - They should now have curly hair and accessories (your custom texture)!

4. **Spawn additional villagers to test:**
   - Press `T` to open chat
   - Type: `/summon minecraft:villager ~ ~ ~`
   - Press Enter
   - A villager with your custom texture should appear!

### Method 2: Verify Texture Before Running

Check the built mod JAR contains your texture:

```bash
# The JAR is built in build/libs/
unzip -l build/libs/joaquintown-1.0.0.jar | grep villager

# Should show:
# assets/joaquintown/textures/entity/villager/joaquin_villager.png
# assets/minecraft/textures/entity/villager/villager.png
```

## üîç What to Look For

When you see villagers in game, they should have:
- ‚úÖ **Curly hair** on top of their head (based on your texture)
- ‚úÖ **Accessories** on their face (based on your texture)
- ‚úÖ **Normal villager body** with profession-specific clothing
- ‚úÖ **Works with all professions** (Farmer, Librarian, etc.)

## üì∏ Taking Screenshots

To verify the texture works:

1. **In game, press F1** to hide UI
2. **Press F2** to take a screenshot
3. **Find screenshot:** `run/screenshots/`
4. **Check if the texture looks correct**

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem: Villagers look normal (not custom)
**Solution:**
- Make sure you ran `./gradlew build` after adding the texture
- Check that the file exists: `ls src/main/resources/assets/minecraft/textures/entity/villager/villager.png`
- Try deleting `run/` directory and running `./gradlew runClient` again

### Problem: Texture looks wrong/broken
**Possible causes:**
- Texture might be wrong size (must be 64x64 pixels)
- Texture might be wrong format (must be PNG)
- Check the texture file: `open src/main/resources/assets/joaquintown/textures/entity/villager/joaquin_villager.png`

### Problem: Game crashes or won't load
**Solution:**
- Check logs in `run/logs/latest.log`
- Verify pack.mcmeta format is correct
- Run `./gradlew clean build` to rebuild from scratch

## üé® Improving Your Texture

After testing, you might want to refine the texture:

1. **Edit the original:**
   ```bash
   open src/main/resources/assets/joaquintown/textures/entity/villager/joaquin_villager.png
   ```

2. **Make changes in Blockbench/Paint.NET/GIMP**

3. **Save the file (same location)**

4. **Copy to override location:**
   ```bash
   cp src/main/resources/assets/joaquintown/textures/entity/villager/joaquin_villager.png \
      src/main/resources/assets/minecraft/textures/entity/villager/villager.png
   ```

5. **Rebuild and test:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ./gradlew runClient
   ```
